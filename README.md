### Overview:
In this project, i'll build a GAN using convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator. This is called a Deep Convolutional GAN, or DCGAN for short. The DCGAN architecture was first explored in 2016 and has seen impressive results in generating new images.

DCGAN is one of the popular and successful network design for GAN. It mainly composes of convolution layers without max pooling or fully connected layers. It uses convolutional stride and transposed convolution for the downsampling and the upsampling.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- GPU
